## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- MySQL Server installed and running.
- Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartNotesOrganizer.git
cd SmartNotesOrganizer
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**
Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 3: Set Up MySQL Database**
1. Open MySQL Workbench or the MySQL command line.
2. Create a new database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE smart_notes_db;
   ```
3. Update the **database credentials** in `db_handler.py`:
   ```python
   DB_HOST = "localhost"
   DB_USER = "your_username"
   DB_PASSWORD = "your_password"
   DB_NAME = "smart_notes_db"
   ```

### **Step 4: Initialize the Database**
Run the following command to create the necessary tables:
```bash
python db_handler.py
```

### **Step 5: Run the Application**
```bash
python ui.py
```

- The main window will display buttons to **Add Notes** and **Exit**.

### **Adding a New Note**
1. Click the **"Add Note"** button.
2. Fill in the **Title**, **Content**, and **Category** fields.
3. Click **"Save"** to add the note to the database.

### **Searching for Notes**

  - Use the keyword search feature to find notes by title or content.

### **Deleting Notes**
- Enter the ID of the note you wish to delete in the console prompt.

## **Modules Breakdown**

### 1. **`db_handler.py`**
Handles database interactions:
- Establishes a connection to the MySQL database.
- Creates the database and tables.
- Functions to add, retrieve, search, and delete notes.

### 2. **`note_manager.py`**
Provides the core logic for managing notes:
- Functions to add, search, display, and delete notes from the database.
- Interactive prompts for console-based usage.

### 3. **`ui.py`**
Creates the graphical user interface using Tkinter:
- Provides buttons and forms for interacting with notes.
- Calls functions from `db_handler.py` for backend processing.

### 4. **`encryption.py` (Optional)**
Handles encryption of note content (can be added as an enhancement):
- Encrypts note content before saving to the database.
- Decrypts content when retrieving notes.

## **Future Enhancements**

1. **Note Encryption**: Add encryption to secure note content.
2. **Rich Text Editor**: Include formatting options (bold, italics, etc.) for note content.
3. **Cloud Sync**: Allow users to sync notes to cloud storage services (Google Drive, Dropbox).
4. **Tagging System**: Enable users to tag notes for better organization.
5. **Dark Mode**: Add a dark theme option for the user interface.
