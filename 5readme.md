## Project Overview

The **College Scheduler** web application is a tool for college students to manage their time effectively. It allows users to:

- Add study sessions, exam preparations, and other events.
- View and manage scheduled tasks.
- Set alarms and alerts for reminders of upcoming events.
- Delete tasks when they are no longer needed.

The application uses **Flask** for the backend, **MySQL** for database management, and a simple **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** frontend to interact with the user.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Scheduler**: Python `schedule` library
- **Notification**: Playsound (for sound alarms)

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

1. Python 3.x
2. MySQL Server
3. Flask
4. MySQL Connector for Python
5. JavaScript and browser for the frontend

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/college-scheduler.git
cd college-scheduler
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

To install the necessary Python dependencies, create a virtual environment and activate it.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```

Then, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Set Up MySQL Database

You need to set up MySQL for the project. Follow these steps:

1. Open MySQL Command Line or MySQL Workbench.
2. Create a new database for the project:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE college_scheduler;
   ```

3. Run the SQL script to create necessary tables (Schedule Table) or use the following SQL:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Schedules (
       schedule_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id INT NOT NULL,
       title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       description TEXT,
       start_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
       end_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
       alert_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
       FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
   );
   ```

4. Configure your MySQL connection in `app.py`:

   ```python
   app.config['MYSQL_HOST'] = 'localhost'
   app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'root'
   app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = 'your-password'
   app.config['MYSQL_DB'] = 'college_scheduler'
   ```

### Step 4: Frontend Setup

The frontend files are located in the `templates/` folder. You can open `index.html` directly in your browser or use a local server to run it.

## Backend - Flask API

The backend is built with Flask and is responsible for handling all the routes that deal with adding, retrieving, and deleting schedules. Hereâ€™s how the backend works:

### Routes:

- **GET /get_schedules/<user_id>**: Fetches all schedules for a given user.
- **POST /add_schedule**: Adds a new schedule to the database.
- **DELETE /delete_schedule/<schedule_id>**: Deletes a specific schedule.

Each route interacts with the MySQL database to retrieve or store data.

Example of adding a schedule via POST request:

```python
@app.route('/add_schedule', methods=['POST'])
def add_schedule():
    data = request.get_json()
    title = data['title']
    description = data['description']
    start_time = data['start_time']
    end_time = data['end_time']
    alert_time = data['alert_time']

    cursor = mysql.connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO Schedules (title, description, start_time, end_time, alert_time) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s)",
                   (title, description, start_time, end_time, alert_time))
    mysql.connection.commit()
    return jsonify({"message": "Schedule added successfully"}), 200
```

## Frontend - User Interface

The frontend is designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface allows students to:

1. **Add Schedules**: Users can input title, description, start time, end time, and alert time to create a new schedule.
2. **View Schedules**: The schedules are displayed in a table format.
3. **Delete Schedules**: Users can delete a schedule by clicking the "Delete" button next to each schedule.

AJAX is used for sending and receiving data from the Flask API without reloading the page.

Example of sending a POST request to add a schedule:

```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:5000/add_schedule', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        title: 'Exam Preparation',
        description: 'Prepare for exam tomorrow',
        start_time: '2024-12-01T08:00',
        end_time: '2024-12-01T12:00',
        alert_time: '2024-12-01T07:30'
    })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => alert(data.message))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

## Database Setup (MySQL)

To ensure your application works smoothly, ensure that your **MySQL database** is properly set up as outlined in the **Setup and Installation** section. 

- Create a `college_scheduler` database.
- Create tables for storing user schedules.
- Ensure your Flask app is correctly connected to MySQL using the correct credentials.

---

## Notification System

The application includes an alarm/notification system that uses the Python **schedule** library. The `notification.py` script checks the database every minute to trigger alarms for schedules with upcoming alert times.

When a schedule's alert time is reached, the system plays a sound alarm and removes or marks the schedule as alerted in the database.

### Example:

```python
import schedule
import time
from playsound import playsound

def check_alerts():
    # Check the database for schedules with alert times
    # Trigger alarms using playsound
    playsound('alarm_sound.mp3')

schedule.every(1).minute.do(check_alerts)
```

---

## Running the Application

To run the application:

1. Ensure the Flask backend is running:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser, or use a local server to serve the HTML.

3. The application should be accessible via `http://localhost:5000`.
